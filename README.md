## To Test Follow These Steps

To start the project, we need to load the assembly codes into the ROM. For this, follow these steps:

Open Main.java in the assembly-code file. Type "java Main core1.txt" after "javac Main.java" to run it into the terminal.

Your singlecore file will be created on the desktop.

Open the circuit in the Logisim file. To enter singlecore information on the ROM, you can right click and upload the file you created after "Load Image" here.

Follow the same steps for multicore steps. Run core2.txt instead of core1.txt.
